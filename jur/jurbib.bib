abstract = "Abstract Context: Voronoi treemaps can be used to effectively visualize software quality attributes of a given software system. Algorithms for computing Voronoi treemaps are non-deterministic making them unsuited for monitoring the development of such attributes over time. Objective: We adapt an existing sweep line algorithm to efficiently compute Voronoi treemaps and we introduce a novel algorithm that adds stability and predictability. Method: We introduce stable and predictable Voronoi treemaps based on additively weighted power Voronoi diagrams. We employ scaled Hilbert curves to place Voronoi sites in the plane, retaining the order in which sites are placed along the curve for easy comparison with revisions of the same software system. Results: Our algorithm achieves a predictable first good approximation of the final location of the sites. We show that our algorithm not only provides more stability, but also that because of better placement it needs fewer iterations to compute its result. As part of our implementation we introduce a visualization to show the difference between two versions of a software system. We also present a small case study in which we use a web based application that implements our work to investigate the usefulness of stability and predictability of visualizations. Conclusion: It is possible to achieve stable and predictable visualizations of software system attributes, while, as a pleasant side effect, decreasing the number of iterations necessary to arrive at the visualization.

  Abstract                 = {Many components of a dependently typed programming language are by now well understood, for example, the underlying type theory, type checking, unification and evaluation. How to combine these components into a realistic and usable high-level language is, however, folklore, discovered anew by successive language implementors. In this paper, I describe the implementation of Idris, a new dependently typed functional programming language. Idris is intended to be a general-purpose programming language and as such provides high-level concepts such as implicit syntax, type classes and do notation. I describe the high-level language and the underlying type theory, and present a tactic-based method for elaborating concrete high-level syntax with implicit arguments and type classes into a fully explicit type theory. Furthermore, I show how this method facilitates the implementation of new high-level language constructs.},

	Abstract = {We present a simple and powerful type inference method for
          dynamically typed languages where no type information is
          supplied by the user. Type inference is reduced to the
          problem of solvability of type inclusion constraints over a
          rich type language that includes function types,
          constructor types, union, intersection, and recursive
          types, and conditional types. Conditional types enables us
          to analyse control flow using type inference, thus
          facilitating computation of accurate types. We demonstrate
          the power and practicality of the method with examples and
          performance results from an implementation.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present a general framework HM(X) for
          Hindley/Milner style type systems with constraints. HM(X) stays in the tradition of the
          Hindley/Milner type system.
          Type systems in HM(X) are sound under a standard untyped compositional semantics that guarantees the
          slogan `well--typed programs can not go wrong'.
          Furthermore, we can give a generic type inference algorithm for HM(X). 
          Under sufficient conditions on X, type inference will always compute the principal
          type of a term. 
          An instance of our framework which deals with polymorphic records is discussed.
          Also, we give a subtyping extension SHM(X) of our HM(X) system.
          In particular, the type inference algorithm for subtypes computes principal types.
          Simplification of the constraints inferred by the type inference algorithm is
          discussed for HM(X) and SHM(X).},
