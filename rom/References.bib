	Abstract = {Objectives The Timed Automata modeling paradigm has emerged from Computer Science as a mature tool for the functional analysis and performance evaluation of timed distributed systems. This study is a first exploration of the suitability of Timed Automata for health economic modeling, using a case study on personalized treatment for metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC). Methods The treatment process has been modeled by creating several independent timed automata, where an automaton represents a patient, a physician, a test, or a treatment/testing guideline schedule. These automata interact via message passing and are fully parameterized with quantitative information. Messages can be passed, asynchronously, from one automaton to one or more other automata, at any point in time, thereby triggering events and decisions in the treatment process. In the automata time is continuous, and both QALYs and costs can be incorporated using (assignable) local clocks. Uncertainty can be modeled using probabilities and timing intervals that can be uniformly or exponentially distributed. Software for building timed automata is freely available for academic use and includes procedures for statistical model checking (SMC) to validate the (internal) behavior and results of the model. Results In several days a Timed Automata model has been produced that is compositional, easy to understand and easy to update. The behavior and results of the model have been assessed using the SMC tool. Actual results for the mCRPC case study obtained from the Timed Automata model are compared with results of a Discrete Event Simulation model in a separate study. Conclusions The Timed Automata paradigm can be successfully applied to evaluate the potential benefits of a personalized treatment process of mCRPC. The compositional nature of the resulting model provides a good separation of all relevant components. This leads to models that are easy to formulate, validate, understand, maintain and update.},

@article{Degeling:2017,
	Abstract = {BackgroundWith the advent of personalized medicine, the field of health economic modeling is being challenged and the use of patient-level dynamic modeling techniques might be required.ObjectivesTo illustrate the usability of two such techniques, timed automata (TA) and discrete event simulation (DES), for modeling personalized treatment decisions.MethodsAn early health technology assessment on the use of circulating tumor cells, compared with prostate-specific antigen and bone scintigraphy, to inform treatment decisions in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer was performed. Both modeling techniques were assessed quantitatively, in terms of intermediate outcomes (e.g., overtreatment) and health economic outcomes (e.g., net monetary benefit). Qualitatively, among others, model structure, agent interactions, data management (i.e., importing and exporting data), and model transparency were assessed.ResultsBoth models yielded realistic and similar intermediate and health economic outcomes. Overtreatment was reduced by 6.99 and 7.02 weeks by applying circulating tumor cell as a response marker at a net monetary benefit of −€1033 and −€1104 for the TA model and the DES model, respectively. Software-specific differences were observed regarding data management features and the support for statistical distributions, which were considered better for the DES software. Regarding method-specific differences, interactions were modeled more straightforward using TA, benefiting from its compositional model structure.ConclusionsBoth techniques prove suitable for modeling personalized treatment decisions, although DES would be preferred given the current software-specific limitations of TA. When these limitations are resolved, TA would be an interesting modeling alternative if interactions are key or its compositional structure is useful to manage multi-agent complex problems.},

@inproceedings{Cardelli2017,
	Abstract = {We present ERODE, a multi-platform tool for the solution and exact reduction of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). ERODE supports two recently introduced, complementary, equivalence relations over ODE variables: forward differential equivalence yields a self-consistent aggregate system where each ODE gives the cumulative dynamics of the sum of the original variables in the respective equivalence class. Backward differential equivalence identifies variables that have identical solutions whenever starting from the same initial conditions. As back-end ERODE uses the well-known Z3 SMT solver to compute the largest equivalence that refines a given initial partition of ODE variables. In the special case of ODEs with polynomial derivatives of degree at most two (covering affine systems and elementary chemical reaction networks), it implements a more efficient partition-refinement algorithm in the style of Paige and Tarjan. ERODE comes with a rich development environment based on the Eclipse plug-in framework offering: (i) seamless project management; (ii) a fully-featured text editor; and (iii) importing-exporting capabilities.},

We have developed the software tool ANIMO (Analysis of Networks with Interactive MOdeling) to provide such computational support and allow insight into the complex networks of signaling events occurring in living cells. ANIMO makes use of timed automata as an underlying model, thereby enabling analysis techniques from computer science like model checking. Biology experts are able to use ANIMO via a user interface specifically tailored for biological applications. In this paper we compare the use of ANIMO with some established formalisms on two case studies.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Models of the dynamics of cellular interaction networks have become increasingly larger in recent years. Formal verification based on model checking provides a powerful technology to keep up with this increase in scale and complexity. The application of modelchecking approaches is hampered, however, by the difficulty for nonexpert users to formulate appropriate questions in temporal logic.Results: In order to deal with this problem, we propose the use of patterns, that is, high-level query templates that capture recurring biological questions and can be automatically translated into temporal logic. The applicability of the developed set of patterns has been investigated by the analysis of an extended model of the network of global regulators controlling the carbon starvation response in Escherichia coli.Availability: GNA and the model of the carbon starvation response network are available at http://www-helix.inrialpes.fr/gnaContact: Hidde.de-Jong@inrialpes.fr},

The abstraction is based on partitioning the state space of a dynamical system using positive invariant sets, which form cells that represent locations of a timed automaton. The abstraction is intended to enable formal verification of temporal properties of dynamical systems without simulating any system trajectory, which is currently not possible. Therefore, conditions for obtaining sound, complete, and refinable abstractions are set up.},

	Abstract = {Purpose: Cartilage homeostasis relies on an intricate balance between anabolic and catabolic processes. In osteoarthritis this balance is shifted towards catabolism, leading to hypertrophy and a gradual degradation of cartilage tissue. So far, drug-based intervention in this process has shown limited progress. We propose to construct a mathematical model of the molecular network that governs key processes in articular cartilage homeostasis. This model can be used as a platform for model expansion by introduction of new experimental findings and hypotheses.

Methods: We recently developed ANIMO (Analysis of Networks with Interactive Modeling), an intuitive software tool for modeling molecular networks. Here, we demonstrate a mathematical model of growth plate cartilage using a combination of literature and experimental data. We show how ANIMO allows for intuitive exploration of the model, despite the size and complexity of the model.

Results: We constructed a network model of regulatory processes in growth plate chondrocytes. In this model the effects downstream of extracellular growth factors FGF, WNT, IGF-1, PTHrP, Ihh, BMP, and TGF-? are integrated into a cellular response. In silico experiments predict the phenotypic outcome for different inputs and starting states of the model.

Osteoarthritic chondrocytes and hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes show strong parallels in their gene expression profile. We have examined the gene expression profiles of growth plate and articular cartilage. In articular cartilage the expression of the WNT and BMP antagonists DKK1, FRZB and GREM1 is over 10-500 fold higher than in growth plate cartilage. This leads us to think that DKK1, FRZB, GREM1 could act as gatekeepers for preventing hypertrophy. We are currently investigating the range of conditions under which these proteins exert their stabilizing effect on the articular cartilage phenotype in the model. Furthermore, we are interrogating the model to obtain in silico leads to targets for novel combination therapies. Such therapies could be used to intervene in the osteoarthritic state of the network and restore the balanced situation of healthy cartilage.

Conclusions: Traditionally, modeling efforts in the realm of molecular cell biology have been the exclusive domain of researchers with a thorough training in mathematics or computer science. We show here that a complex model that is intuitively amenable to exploration and adaptation by biologists is an invaluable asset in cartilage research. Expansion of an existing model with DKK1, FRZB and GREM1 provided evidence for their role in preserving the articular cartilage phenotype.},

@inproceedings{Schivo:2012aa,
	Abstract = {When analysing complex interaction networks occurring in biological cells, a biologist needs computational support in order to understand the effects of signalling molecules (e.g. growth factors, drugs). ANIMO (Analysis of Networks with Interactive MOdelling) is a tool that allows the user to create and explore executable models of biological networks, helping to derive hypotheses and to plan wet-lab experiments. The foundations of the tool are based on Timed Automata, which can be analysed via the UPPAAL model checker. Thanks to Timed Automata, we can provide a formal semantics for the domain-specific language used to represent signaling networks. This enforces precision and uniformity in the definition of signalling pathways, contributing to the integration of signalling event models into complex, crosstalk-driven networks. We propose an approach to discretization of reaction kinetics that allows us to efficiently use UPPAAL as the computational engine to explore the dynamic cell behaviour. A 
user friendly interface makes the use of Timed Automata completely transparent to the biologist, while keeping the expressive power intact. This allows to define relatively simple, yet faithful models of complex biological interactions. The resulting timed behaviour is displayed graphically, allowing for an intuitive and interactive modelling experience.},

	Abstract = {The use of mobile devices is limited by the battery lifetime. Some devices have the option to connect an extra battery, or to use smart battery-packs with multiple cells to extend the lifetime. In these cases, scheduling the batteries over the load to exploit recovery properties  usually extends the system lifetime. Straightforward scheduling schemes, like round robin or choosing the best battery available, already provide a big improvement compared to a sequential discharge of the batteries. In this paper we compare these scheduling schemes with the optimal scheduling scheme produced with a priced-timed automaton battery model (implemented and evaluated in Uppaal Cora). We see that in some cases the results of the simple scheduling schemes are close to optimal. However, the optimal schedules also clearly show that there is still room for improving the battery lifetimes.},
